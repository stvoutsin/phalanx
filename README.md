# Phalanx

This is the Argo CD repository for the Rubin Science Platform.
It stores the root Argo CD application, deployment configuration for the other applications, the installer, and other helper scripts.

See [phalanx.lsst.io](https://phalanx.lsst.io/) for full documentation.

Phalanx is developed by the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/).

A phalanx is a SQuaRE deployment (Science Quality and Reliability Engineering, the team responsible for the Rubin Science Platform).
Phalanx is how we ensure that all of our services work together as a unit.
