This documentation of the internal implementation details of Phalanx is intended primarily for people doing development on the Phalanx infrastructure itself, as opposed to a Phalanx :doc:`application </developers/index>` or :doc:`environment </admin/index>`.
Most users of Phalanx and administrators of Phalanx environments do not need to know this information.
