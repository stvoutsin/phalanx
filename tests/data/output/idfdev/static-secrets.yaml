  ALERT_HOOK:
    description: >-
      Slack web hook to which mobu should report failures and daily status.
    value: null
  app-alert-webhook:
    description: >-
      Slack web hook to which to post internal application alerts. This secret
      is not used directly by mobu, but is copied from here to all of the
      applications that report internal problems to Slack. It should normally
      be separate from mobu's own web hook, since the separate identities
      attached to the messages helps make the type of mesasge clearer, but
      the same web hook as mobu's own alerts can be used in a pinch.
